- Element reparenting on drag
- Nested element flattening for display

### Ruler System

Professional boundary controls featuring:

- Horizontal and vertical rulers (Google Docs style)
- Draggable triangle markers (blue for start, red for end)
- Three-tier tick marks:
  - Major ticks (12px) every 100px
  - Minor ticks (8px) every 50px
  - Tiny ticks (4px) every 10px
- Real-time boundary updates with reactive effects
- Coordinate scaling for accurate positioning

### Property Panel

- Position and dimensions (X, Y, width, height)
- Typography (7 font families, 12 font sizes)
- Font weight (normal, bold) and style (normal, italic)
- Color picker for text and shapes
- Element-specific properties
- Delete functionality

### Resize Tool

Advanced resize system with:

- Boundary-aware resizing

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
yarn dev              # Start development server
yarn dev -- --open    # Open browser automatically

# Building
yarn build           # Production build
yarn preview         # Preview production build

# Code Quality
yarn lint            # Run ESLint

### Code Style

This project follows:

- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **ESLint** for linting
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Svelte 5** syntax and patterns

### Key Development Patterns

1. **State Management**: Uses Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`)
2. **Component Architecture**: Functional components with clear props
3. **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the application
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Creating a Document

1. **Navigate to Builder**: Click "Start Building" from the homepage
2. **Add Elements**: Drag text, shapes, or images from the toolbar
3. **Customize Elements**: Select elements to edit properties in the panel
4. **Adjust Boundaries**: Drag ruler markers to set canvas boundaries
5. **Multi-page Support**: Add additional pages as needed
6. **Save & Export**: Save your document to locally or export as PDF

### Element Manipulation

- **Move**: Click and drag elements on the canvas
- **Resize**: Use corner handles on selected elements
- **Edit**: Select elements to modify properties in the panel
- **Delete**: Use the delete button in the property panel

### Boundary System

- **Set Boundaries**: Drag triangle markers on rulers
- **Snap-to-Grid**: Elements automatically align to boundaries
